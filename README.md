# AECN
Appalachian Early Childhood Network

This project attempts to make clear where the childcare deserts are located in Eastern Kentucky. It also seeks to illustrate an estimated picture of the Eastern Mountain Region by county, utilizing US Census data. Hopefully, with a more complete picture, audiences will have a better understanding of the challenges that come with developing and supporting a robust network of early childcare options in Eastern Kentucky. 

The process of this project is outlined in a Juypter Notebook file titled "AECN_Capstone"
